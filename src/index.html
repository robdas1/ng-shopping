<!--
  index.html

  This file serves as the entry point for the Angular application. It sets up the basic HTML
  structure and includes the root component of the application. The file also includes meta tags
  for character encoding and viewport settings, as well as a link to the favicon.

  The <app-root> element is the root component of the Angular application. Angular will replace
  this element with the content of the AppComponent when the application is bootstrapped.
