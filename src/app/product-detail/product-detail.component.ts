/**
 * ProductDetailComponent
 * 
 * This component is responsible for displaying the details of a product. It
 * leverages Angular's component architecture, including dependency injection
 * for services like ActivatedRoute and Store from NgRx for state management.
 * The component subscribes to route parameters to fetch the 'id' of the product
 * and uses the NgRx Store to select the product details from the application's
 * state. This approach decouples the component from direct data access, instead
 * relying on the application's state management infrastructure to provide the
 * necessary data, promoting a reactive and scalable application architecture.
 * 
 * The use of CommonModule allows the component to utilize common Angular
 * directives in its template, enhancing its functionality and presentation.
 * Following the overall pattern for this app, The component is marked as 
 * standalone, indicating it can be used independently without requiring an 
 * Angular module.
 * 
 * This component is an essential part of the product browsing experience, 
 * allowing users to learn more about a product before making a purchase 
 * decision.
